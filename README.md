# My dotfiles.

Uhm... So here is my .files.

## Some explaination

* I use systemd to manage my user session, see .config/systemd for relative files.
* I use a forked version of oh-my-zsh (I haven't chnaged much though).
* My .conkyrc may not look nice on your desktop.
* My vim colorscheme may not look nice for you either. (Don't criticize my taste!)
* I3 is a good window manager.
* Do mount a tmpfs at /caches.
* .xmodmap swaps your Caps Lock and Control, delete it if you don't like this.
